# Book Your Room

Room Rental Website Application


Introduction:
This is a web application for renting rooms to users, built using NodeJS and MongoDB. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The web pages are designed to be responsive and can be accessed on various devices.

Features:

Room listing: Users can view available rooms on the website.

Room booking: Users can book a room by providing their details and payment information.

Room management: Administrators can manage rooms, add new rooms, update existing rooms, and delete rooms that are no longer available.

User management: Administrators can manage users, view their booking history, and update their details.

Authentication and authorization: Users and administrators have their own login credentials, and the website ensures that only authorized users can access certain pages.

Technologies Used:

NodeJS: A JavaScript runtime environment used to build the web application's server-side logic.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage data for the application.

Express: A NodeJS web application framework used to simplify the development of the application's server-side logic.

EJS: A templating language used to generate dynamic HTML pages on the server-side.

Bootstrap: A CSS framework used to make the web pages responsive and mobile-friendly.
